                    <li>Start with your rectangular paper, orient it vertically, with the long edges going up and down. Fold the bottom half up to the top.Fold the bottom right corner over to the left corner and make a small pinch, just enough to crease the paper. Open it back up.</li>
                    <li>Using the crease as a guide, fold the left and right bottom corners up and to the middle. Flatten the folded pieces down. Rotate the paper. Fold one layer from the bottom up along the bottom of the front flaps.</li>
                    <li>Flip the paper over to the other side. Fold the bottom edge up in the same way. Unfold, and then fold the bottom right corner in along the crease you made. Repeat on the bottom left flap.</li>
                    <li>Re-fold the bottom edge back up. Open the bottom of the model. Look at the corners. Flatten and then insert the overlapping flap on the left underneath the right section.</li>
                    <li>Fold one layer up to the top. Repeat on the back. Open the bottom of the model.</li>
                    <li>Pull apart the left and right flaps. Flatten it out, in the shape of a boat. Open it slightly. The triangle in the middle resembles a sail.</li>

                <ul style="color:#0037ff">
                    <li> Step 1: Start with a square piece of origami paper. If you only have regular 8.5x11 paper, follow these instructions to make a square sheet.
                        You can also use these colorful Printable Origami Paper.</li>
                    <li> Step 2: Fold the paper in half by folding the top corner to the bottom corner.
                        You should have an upside down triangle.</li>
                    <li> Step 3: Fold part of the top down so that the edge is about halfway down.
                        Don't make this flap too thin because this will become the wings.</li>
                    <li> Step 4: Turn the paper over.</li>
                    <li>Step 5: Take the bottom corner of the top layer and fold it up like this.</li>
                    <li>Step 6: Fold the figure in half by folding the left side over to the right.</li>
                    <li>Step 7: Now fold that same flap back like this to make one of the wings.</li>
                    <li>Step 8: Fold the other wing back also.</li>
                    <li>Step 9: Push the center of the head in and flatten. This is called an inside reverse fold.</li>
                    <li>Step 10: And tada! You have yourself a bird. Now set it free! Just kidding. Don't throw it in the air. It will just fall down and you'll be disappointed.</li>
